 # RFM Analysis 

## 1. Introduction and Goal 
### Introduction 
In today's competitive marketplace, businesses strive to understand customer behavior in order to increase engagement, retention, and sales. One of the most effective methods for this is the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, a proven framework that segments customers based on how recently they have made a purchase (Recency), how often they purchase (Frequency), and how much they spend (Monetary). By leveraging RFM analysis, companies can better target their customers, optimize marketing efforts, and boost revenue. In this project, we utilize the RFM framework to segment customers from a dataset that includes orders, customer information, products, and locations, to draw actionable insights for the business.

### Goal
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer purchasing behavior using the RFM framework to create meaningful customer segments. These segments will help identify key patterns in customer engagement and spending, allowing the business to develop tailored marketing strategies. Additionally, this project aims to analyze sales trends across product categories, channels, and locations, offering deeper insights into the most profitable segments and products. Ultimately, the goal is to optimize customer retention strategies, maximize revenue, and inform decision-making around marketing and product offerings.
